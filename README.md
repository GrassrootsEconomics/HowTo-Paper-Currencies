# How To Paper Currencies
This repository holds all of the documents that will help you plan for the future implementation of your community currency project. 

It acts as a support for the GrassrootsEconomics MOOC that we are hosting on our website. If you have not seen this material take a click [here](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/mooc) to check it out. If you come from there, welcome!

We will cover the following topics:

- [Planning](#planning-the-project)
- [Data Collection](#data-collection)
- [Training Materials](#training-materials)

Eventhough we are dividing the information into these three categories, bare in mind that when you implement there will be parallel processes going on at all times. 

## Planning the project

The most important thing for a succesful implementation of a community currency (and any project in general) is good planning. We suggest you devote lots of time and energy to this before jumping into this huge task.

## Data Collection

Being able to measure the impact of your projects is crucial. Part of this is done through baseline and inline surveys. They have changed a lot through out the years and will probably continue to do so. Our latest version has been made to try to capture the essential information without them being too long. We advice you take them as a starting reference point but by all means do adapt them to the needs and circunstances of the community you're planning to work with.
